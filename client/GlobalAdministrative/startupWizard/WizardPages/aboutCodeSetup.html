                                Most of the code lists available to be setup are Entity / Tenant based.  Each Parent Entity / Tenant can setup their own code lists. This gives better flexibility to the multi-tenant system.

                                Child Entities / Tenants have very few code lists that can be set separate from that of their parent, and instead inherit the parent code lists to keep the system setup much easier for new child / client tenants.

                                    The system has the ability to export and import most of the data contained within it.  Using JSON (Java-script Object Notation based files) so you can much more easily help tenants get setup quickly.
