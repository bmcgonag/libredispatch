        <h5>Multi-tenancy</h5>
        <p class="flow-text">
            The system is designed to be fully multi-tenant capable.  Each tenant is an 'Entity'. When running through the 
            wizard, you'll be asked to create an initial Global Entity (or tenant).  This tenant can be used to fully control 
            and use the system as a single tenant, but it is highly recommended that you create the Global Entity and restrict 
            user membership of that entity to personnel you wish to have full control over the system in the Role of Global Admin.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Next, you'll create a new Entity to be the Global Entity (just remember there can only be 1 Global entity in the system).  Assign yourself to that entity, and verify your account.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Then start assigning user level personnel to this entity.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
            Finally, the system uses a Parent -> Child relation for entities. 
        </p>

            <strong>For Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
                You may have a dispatch center that dispatches for multiple client agencies. Each of those client agencies can be setup as their own Entity / Tenant under the dispatch Parent Entity.  You can set a new Entity as a Parent (separate Tenant in the system) by selecting that option from the drop-down menu during setup.
